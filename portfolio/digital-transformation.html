    <h1>Project: Digital Transformation</h1>
    <h2>Company: Northrop Grumman</h2>
    <h2>Role: UX Researcher</h2>
    <h3>Team: UX Researcher and Lead UX Researcher</h3>
    <h3>When: Fall 2020</h3>
    <h3>Activities Performed: User Interviews, Card Sorting, Heuristic Analysis</h3>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>As part of Northrop Grumman' s Digital Transformation, an internal knowledge portal was created. Its goal is to be a hub
    for anyone looking to improve their team and program. UX Research was needed to (1) establish the effectiveness of the
    current site and (2) identify improvements that are actionable.</p>
    <p>
    First, I assisted the Lead Researcher in conducting User Interviews to get qualitative impressions of the current site and what type of information
    was useful and needed to be added.
    </p>
    <p>
    Several resources were provided in the User Interviews which the team wanted to include on the site. So along with the Lead Researcher, we did a Card Sorting activity
    with several users to understand how they would organize the resources.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also participated in a Heuristic Analysis of all sites that are part of Digital Transformation to identify at a high
    level whether they are satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>The content of the analysis is proprietary of Northrop Grumman. Further details can be provided upon request.</p>
